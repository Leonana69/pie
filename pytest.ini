# Custom markers for test categorization and selective execution

markers =
    # Test types
    unit: Unit tests - fast, isolated tests of individual components
    integration: Integration tests - test component interactions and workflows
    performance: Performance tests - benchmarking and timing-sensitive tests
    tdd: Test-driven development tests that should fail until implementation exists
    
    # Test characteristics
    slow: Slow-running tests that may take significant time to complete
    error_handling: Tests that specifically validate error conditions and recovery
    platform_specific: Tests that depend on specific platform capabilities
    resource_management: Tests that validate resource allocation and cleanup
    hot_reload: Tests that validate dynamic reloading capabilities
    operation_execution: Tests that validate plugin operation execution
