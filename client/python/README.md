# Symphony Toolkit

A concise Python toolkit to interact with the Symphony server:

- Upload LIP (\*.wasm) binaries
- Check if a LIP is already uploaded
- Launch a LIP on Symphony
- Interact with running LIP instances in real-time (send/receive messages, terminate, etc.)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example
Refer to [main.py](./main.py) for a usage example.
